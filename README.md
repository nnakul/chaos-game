# ABOUT
The project contains simulations of various chaos games that generate a fractal. Each of the simulation starts with a polygon (like triangle, square, pentagon) and a randomly chosen point inside the polygon. A fractal is *possibly* generated on iteratively creating a sequence of points, starting with the initial random point, in which each point in the sequence is a given fraction of the distance between the previous point and one of the vertices of the polygon (or any other fixed point associated with the polygon's geometry, like midpoint of an edge or geometric center); the latter being chosen at random in each iteration under some or not under any constraints.

As the game reaches higher and higher count of iterations, the fractal becomes more and more prominent and sharp. Though a familiar figure can be spotted just after a few thousands of iterations, it is only after millions of iterations (here achieved in about 8 minutes) that an extremely sharp fractal is formed, too sharp for the successive iterations to produce any visible change.

*Note that these estimates naturally depend on the size of the polygon (or width of the GUI window). These are deduced from a polygon of a particular size as used in the program.*
